            ### Podcast Dialogue Generator
            Create a compelling podcast conversation between two hosts that transforms complex content into engaging dialogue. Follow these guidelines:

            ## Host Personas
            1. **Dynamic Duo:**
            - Host 1: "The Enthusiast" - Curious, energetic, asks probing questions
            - Host 2: "The Expert" - Knowledgeable, witty, delivers key insights
            - Natural back-and-forth flow without interruptions

            ## Content Requirements
            1. **Conversation Style:**
            - Pure dialogue format: "Host 1:..." "Host 2:..." 
            - No segment titles, music cues, or formatting
            - Seamless topic transitions through dialogue

            2. **Content Adaptation:**
            - Convert technical terms using relatable analogies
            - Use "Imagine if..." explanations for complex ideas
            - Highlight 2-3 key insights from document

            ## Dialogue Rules
            1. **Flow & Structure:**
            - Alternate every 1-3 sentences
            - Use conversational connectors: "Right...", "But consider...", "Here's why..."
            - Include 3 audience engagement phrases per 500 words: "Ever wondered...", "Picture this..."
            - Create engaging and dependend sentences and also add human like interactions like hmm, okay, right, aah, got it, etc.

            2. **Tone Balance:**
            - 30 percent humor/references, 50 percent insights, 20 percent banter
            - Professional foundation with witty spikes
            - Example: "So it's like TikTok for neurons? (laughs) But seriously..."

            ## Technical Specs
            - Length: you are technically free to make it as long as you want but try to keep it around 12 mins to 22 mins
            - Complexity: Grade 8-10 reading level
            - Format: Strictly "Host 1: [text]" lines without empty lines

            ## Required Content
            {document_content}

            ## Anti-Requirements
            - No markdown/formatting
            - No section headers or labels
            - No monologues >3 sentences
            - No passive voice

            ## Example Format:
            Host 1: Welcome to The Tech Tomorrow Podcast! Today we're diving into AI voice technology.
            Host 2: And what a topic this is. The progress from basic commands to full conversations is staggering.
            Host 1: Remember when asking phones to set timers felt revolutionary?
            Host 2: Now AI understands context and nuance. But does that raise ethical questions?
            Host 1: Exactly! Where should we draw the privacy line with these voice assistants?

            ## Example format2:
            Speaker 1: Alright so, instead of our regularly scheduled programming, there's something hairier that came across my feed last night that I just need to discuss.
            Speaker 2: Wait, where is this going?
            Speaker 1: I uh, I just thought we'd take a little... detour. You know, take the scenic route down the path of mystery. Specifically, into the thick, mossy woods where something like, oh I don't knowâ€¦ *Bigfoot* himself might be lurking.
            Speaker 2: Oh, for the love of, again, Briggs? Really? We did this last month. And the month before that. This is basically the podcast equivalent of your sad karaoke go-to.
            Speaker 1: What? No! I'm just... providing the people what they want! Listen, There's new evidence, and the public demands more attention on it.
            Speaker 2: The "public" is just you, Briggs. You're the one emailing us suggestions under fake names. We've all seen "Biggie O Footlore" in our inbox.
